The East Zone of São Paulo Exhibition is a website developed by Gustavo Rodrigues (3rd year ADS AMS) with classmates and Professor Rafael. It showcases art that captures life in São Paulo’s East Zone — exploring youth, people, homes, businesses, faith, LGBT themes, and parks through art, culture, and technology.
